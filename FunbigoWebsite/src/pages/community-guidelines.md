# **Funbigo \- Create, Play, Share\! Community Guidelines**

Application: Funbigo \- Create, Play, Share\!  
Developer: AppDevBar (Referred to herein as the "Service Provider")
Effective Date: 2025-11-29  
These Community Guidelines (the “Guidelines”) establish the expectations for user behavior and content on the **Funbigo** mobile application. By using our platform, you agree to adhere to these rules, which are enforced by the **Service Provider** to ensure a safe, respectful, and positive environment for all users.

## **1\. Prohibited Content and Conduct (General Rules)**

Users must not create, upload, share, or engage in behavior that falls under these categories. Violations will result in content removal or account suspension.

* **Hate Speech and Harassment:** Content that promotes discrimination, disparages, or harasses individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, or serious disability.
* **Violence and Threats:** Content that promotes, incites, or threatens violence against individuals or groups. This includes threats of self-harm, though users struggling with mental health should be directed toward appropriate resources.
* **Illegal Activity:** Content or behavior that facilitates illegal acts, including the sale of illegal drugs, regulated goods, or engaging in fraud.
* **Private Information:** Sharing the private, personally identifiable information (PII) of others without their express consent (e.g., phone numbers, home addresses, non-public emails).
* **Inappropriate Adult Content:** Content that is excessively graphic, sexually explicit, or promotes sexual services. While the platform may allow mature content appropriate for its age rating, sexual exploitation or non-consensual content is strictly prohibited.

## **2\. Reporting, Moderation, and Action Mechanisms**

We are committed to actively preventing, detecting, and removing prohibited material and conduct.

### **User Feedback and Reporting**

Given our limited resources as a small developer, the primary mechanism for reporting content or conduct that violates these Guidelines is currently via email.

Users must report violations by sending an email to our general support contact (appdevbar@gmail.com) with the following details: the nature of the violation, the user ID or content URL, and any relevant screenshots.

Reports related to child safety are handled with the highest urgency and escalated immediately to our designated safety contact. We are committed to developing a more streamlined in-app reporting feature in the future.

## **3\. Zero Tolerance Policy: Child Safety and Exploitation (CSAE)**

This is our strictest policy. We maintain a **zero-tolerance policy** toward child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) and child sexual abuse material (CSAM).

Any content, creation, communication, or user behavior that falls into the following categories is strictly prohibited and constitutes a material violation of these Guidelines:

* **Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM):** The creation, uploading, sharing, or distribution of any visual depiction, including photos, videos, or computer-generated imagery, involving the sexual exploitation of a minor.
* **Grooming:** Any attempt to solicit or establish trust with a minor for the purpose of sexual exploitation or abuse.
* **Child Endangerment:** Any content or behavior that sexualizes, abuses, or otherwise endangers the safety, well-being, or development of a child.

**Enforcement:** Users found to be in violation of this policy will face immediate and permanent account suspension. We reserve the right to remove all associated content and cooperate fully with law enforcement authorities.

### **Addressing CSAM (Self-Certification)**

The **Service Provider** certifies that the **Funbigo** app takes appropriate action to address CSAM. This includes:

1. **Swift Removal:** Immediately removing content that is confirmed to be CSAM or related CSAE material upon obtaining actual knowledge of it.
2. **Account Banning:** Permanently banning the accounts of any user found to have participated in the creation, sharing, or possession of such material.

## **4\. Enforcement and Appeal**

The consequences for violating these Guidelines vary based on the severity of the violation, ranging from content removal and temporary suspensions to permanent account bans (for CSAE/CSAM violations).

* **Account Review:** Users whose content or behavior is reported may be subject to review by our moderation team.
* **Appeals Process:** If your account is suspended or content is removed for a non-CSAE violation, you have the right to appeal the decision by contacting our support team at appdevbar@gmail.com.

## **5\. Legal Compliance and Reporting**

The **Service Provider** certifies that **Funbigo** complies with all applicable child safety laws and regulations, including having a process in place for mandatory reporting:

* We will promptly report confirmed instances of CSAM, as defined by relevant law, to the **National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)** or the appropriate regional law enforcement agencies, in accordance with legal obligations.

## **6\. Child Safety Point of Contact**

We have designated a specific point of contact to receive and address notifications from Google Play regarding CSAE content or enforcement procedures.

## **7\. Policy Review**
